# GDP Dashboard with Streamlit

This project is a **dynamic dashboard** built with **Streamlit** to visualize GDP data. It allows users to filter GDP information by sector, year, and value range. The dashboard provides visualizations such as line plots, heatmaps, and pie charts for better insights. The app is **Dockerized** for easy setup and deployment.

---

## Features

- Filter GDP by **sectors** and **categories** with multi-select checkboxes.
- **Range sliders** to fine-tune year and value selection.
- **"Unselect All" button** to reset sector selections quickly.
- Visualizations:
  - **Line Chart** for GDP values over time.
